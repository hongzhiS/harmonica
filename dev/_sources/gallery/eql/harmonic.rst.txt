Gridding and upward continuation
================================

Most potential field surveys gather data along scattered and uneven flight
lines or ground measurements. For a great number of applications we may need to
interpolate these data points onto a regular grid at a constant altitude.
Upward-continuation is also a routine task for smoothing, noise attenuation,
source separation, etc.

Both tasks can be done simultaneously through an *equivalent layer*
[Dampney1969]_. We will use :class:`harmonica.EQLHarmonic` to estimate the
coefficients of a set of point sources (the equivalent layer) that fit the
observed data. The fitted layer can then be used to predict data values
wherever we want, like on a grid at a certain altitude. The sources for
:class:`~harmonica.EQLHarmonic` in particular are placed one beneath each data
point at a constant relative depth from the elevation of the data point
following [Cooper2000]_.

The advantage of using an equivalent layer is that it takes into account the 3D
nature of the observations, not just their horizontal positions. It also allows
data uncertainty to be taken into account and noise to be suppressed though the
least-squares fitting process. The main disadvantage is the increased
computational load (both in terms of time and memory).
